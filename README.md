# Particle simulation

This is a simple particle simulation for learning and fun.

This project requires sfml dll files in the resources directory next to the executable produced.

## Key Concepts
1. **Particle Physics**: Particles move dynamically based on their velocity and external forces (e.g., gravity, wind).
    - Collisions are detected with walls, particles, or obstacles, and velocities are adjusted accordingly.
